            A lightweight backpacking chair is a luxury item that can make the camping portion of a backpacking trip much more enjoyable and relaxed. If you like to sit around a campfire to socialize at night or read outdoors while sitting upright, bringing a lightweight trail chair along can really enhance a backpacking trip. With trail weights between 1 and 2 pounds, the added weight of carrying a backpacking chair isn’t that onerous, especially if it’s offset by using other lightweight backpacking gear.</p>

                Hiking the Presidential Traverse Trail

                The first thing you should know about the Presidential Traverse Trail is that there isn’t a trail by that name in New Hampshire’s White Mountains, despite the fact that it’s listed as such in the AllTrails app. That fact will quickly bite you in the ass because the trail signs you encounter won’t match the information in your app. There are a lot of trails between the north and south ends of the Presidentials and it’s really easy to get lost unless you’ve taken the precaution of buying the AMC’s Presidential Range Map, planning out the sequence of trails you want to follow, and carrying the map with you so you can refer to it.</p>
